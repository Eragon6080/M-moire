  abstract={Understanding and developing large applications often leads to a situation where the developer becomes lost. Software visualization aims to help with these problems by providing visual insights and helps to navigate, and, when properly done, also to visually model software. Although the advantages of virtual reality in software visualization have already been demonstrated, relatively limited research has been done in the area of programming.In this paper, we present a virtual reality programming environment, with built-in round-trip engineering support and run-time compilation of source code that allows live programming. The study carried out shows that users are capable of solving complex programming tasks in our VR environment, which performed better in terms of usability and user experience, but the evaluation results also point to still persistent VR related problems.},
